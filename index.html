					<h2>When Scam Happens, Discover Bank Doesn't Have Your Back</h2>
					<div class="experience-content">
						<p>I lost $700 to scammers. Discover Bank's response? "It's not disputable. You're on your own."</p>
						
						<p>Let me be clear: I fell victim to a sophisticated job scam. The scammers directed me to use Cash App to send money as part of what I believed was a legitimate employment requirement. I was trying to keep a job I thought was real. Instead, I was being scammed.</p>
						
						<p>As soon as I realized what happened, I immediately contacted Discover Bank. I thought this was exactly what credit card protection was for—to help customers when they're victims of fraud. I was wrong.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Discover Bank's response was immediate and final: "Because you used Cash App, this transaction is not disputable. We can't help you."</strong></p>
						
						<p>That's it. No investigation. No attempt to understand the situation. No consideration that this was a scam, not a voluntary transaction. Just a blanket policy that protects scammers, not customers.</p>
						
						<p>I spent hours on the phone with multiple representatives and two different supervisors—Ben Wilkinson and Kay. The conversations were infuriating. They kept repeating the same script: "Cash App transactions are peer-to-peer transfers and not disputable." When I explained this wasn't a peer-to-peer transaction—I was sending money to what I believed was an employer as part of a job requirement—they didn't care. The policy was the policy.</p>
						
						<p>Here's what really shows how unreliable Discover Bank is: <strong>They couldn't even send me their own policy documents via email.</strong> Ben promised to email me the official rules, then switched to mailing it (which takes 2 weeks). When I called back, Kay gave me completely different information and refused to provide her last name or employee number. Two supervisors, two different stories, zero accountability.</p>
						
						<p>They told me my only options were to contact the Better Business Bureau or my state's attorney general. Think about that: <strong>Discover Bank, a major financial institution, told me to go complain to government agencies instead of helping me themselves.</strong> They literally gave up on their own customer.</p>
						
						<p>The most frustrating part? They acknowledged I was a victim of a scam, but then said it didn't matter because I "participated in the transaction." So according to Discover Bank, if scammers trick you into sending money, that's your fault, not theirs. They have no responsibility to protect you.</p>
						
						<p>I'm sharing this because people need to know: <strong>Discover Bank does not protect scam victims.</strong> They hide behind policies that favor scammers. They give contradictory information. They refuse to investigate. They blame you for being scammed. And when you ask for help, they tell you to go somewhere else.</p>
						
						<p>If you're considering Discover Bank, ask yourself: Do you want a bank that protects you when something goes wrong, or one that abandons you the moment you need help? My $700 loss taught me that Discover Bank will always choose the latter.</p>

							<div class="transcript-intro">
								<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Only the key parts of the conversation are shown below.</em></p>
							</div>
							<div class="transcript-content">
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, um, so you're saying that, so we went through the fraud. We fell in for the fraud, and then that fraud. Um, we ended up losing, well, $700 through the Discover card. However, uh, you guys were saying that this is not going to be, uh, disputable. So we will just lose that money. Is that correct, Mr. Ben?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> That is correct. This is a Cash App transaction, electronic person to person transaction and it is not disputable.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> It is not about the cash app, there were multiple platforms that were involved.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Please, don't, don't, please, uh, you do understand the situation, correct? If, if this was your family's matter, then you would not say this was just simply, uh, okay, cash app transaction, therefore, the rule books as, blah, blah, this was a unique situation as you mentioned before, that eventually this was taken out. The reason why we used even used Cash App was because it was directed by the employer specifically, and then we did that to keep our job. Which was a scam. And it wasn't just about the cash app. There was a multiple platform involved. There was a, uh, the Bitcoin related wallet platform as it was. So it wasn't just about Cash app. Uh, and Cash App was one of them, but then I don't know why you guys are just picking on this cash yet to make this dispute, dispute not valid. That's that's how I'm feeling. Uh, you know, that's how I feel like, that's how I'm perceiving this conversation right now. So if there's a way for us to escalate this further, because this is not something that we're taking advantage of.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I understand that you feel like you're a victi- been a victim of a scam, and I'm aware of the situation, but because you use this type of, because, because you use Cash App to pay for this transaction, it's not disputable. This is, this is considered an inconvenience.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And this is the ultimate, there is no other way around this type of situation. If you guys get this kind of scam, fallen customers, then this is what you guys tell them?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Well, I guess scammers are too smart to make this type of transaction then, right? They know that Discover, or there's a less chance that card companies will not make things disputable if they use Cash App, right? So we fell for that.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Well, that's what you're saying, right? It is because of the Cash App, this is not disputable, right? Is that correct?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I am not inferring anything, sir. I don't I-I don't know why they they chose the Cash app. I can't I can't I can't draw any conclusions on that.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So you're saying that even those, even the scammers are taking, taking advantage of the members of your customers, you guys are not able to help.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> disputable. The method of the method of payment that you used,this is considered an inconvenience.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> This is a peer to peer electronic money transfer transaction.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> This was not a peer to peer transaction. This was, we sent it to the employer.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> This was not sent to our friend, to our family, this was not for a gift. This was a, this was deemed as an investment to keep the job to the employer directly. It happens to be Cash App.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I wish there was, I wish, I, Mr. Mr. Song. I I would I'd be happy to leave some great feedback on the account. I'm sorry I wish I had better news for you but this this type of transaction is not disputable.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can I have your, so Mr. B-E-N, right? B as baby, E as elephant, N as Nancy, is there right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Correct. yes.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And what would be your, uh, or employer number, if you cannot give me your last name, can I have your employer number, please?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I'll give you my last name. It's Wilkinson spelled W I L K I N S O N.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay. Okay, so to summarize this, um, the, the, no matter what the situation is, it's because we used the Cash app, it's not disputable. Therefore, we're just gonna have to lose that money. That we sent. Is that correct?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Well, it, so if, if you, if this was not if you, if you made the same transaction. It wasn't done through Cash App. Then it, then we, we, we would have more options, but because this was, the, the, because this was done facilitated through Cash App, it's not disputable.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, so that's what you're saying, right? No matter what the situation is, because we use the Cash app. This is not disputable, is that correct? Just because of that.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> That is correct, sir, that that's what I'm saying, yes.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, and um, is there any official documentation that you can send me through email or anything like that? Regarding this, that is stating this?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> That is a great question. We actually did send correspondence uh, back on the 12th. Excuse me, the 4th of December in regards to this, this transaction. I can resend it to you if you'd like.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yes, um, do you have the email or?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I can I, I can uh send it to the, the, the uh address/email that we have on file. Let me resend it okay?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, the email …(I gave them my e-mail).</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Correct.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Right, let me resend those documents for you. Just a moment here. I'm actually gonna have to mail this information to you. Can I have you confirm for me please your mailing address?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> (I gave them my mailing address).</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Thank you. All right. so I, I wish I had better news, news for you folks. I really do. I'm sorry that this happened but this because the Cash App was used we're not able to take keep us to this further on your behalf.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Do you happen to have, like, your reason for this, like, why specifically?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Because this is an electronic transfer, sir, the Cash app is used to send money between parties. It's not, it's, this is not a situation where, uh, it's considered like paying cash. The electronic version of cash. This is not a- Cash transactions, that like, Cash app, then transactions are genuinely not disputable.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I mean, anything can be cash in the case. I mean, if I buy anything from Amazon, that's still a cash, if you consider it that way. We never touched the actual cash.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> But that's not, that that's not, that's not a cash, that, that's Amazon is not a peer to peer, cash service, but Cash App is, however. It's the, it's the type of merchant that was used, sir. It's not, and the type of transaction.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> It i- it is about the Cash App. Cash app is a peer to peer money transfer between parties once the money is transferred that that that's all that the cash app is used for.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> The reason is because. The reason is because. The transaction was made, via the Cash App, transitions made via Cash App are not disputable.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So why is that? So why is that not protected? Why is that?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Because, it's because it you used it, you used the cash transfer service, uh, uh, cash app, it's specifically used to transfer funds between parties.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, but what's the, the underlying reason? Is it because we willingly sent it ourselves or how does it differ?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Correct. Yeah, you partic- you participated in the transaction, it doesn't, it doesn't, you were the victim of a scam. I, I, I agree with you, but it's not fraud because you participated in the transaction, being a victim of a scam and being, fraud is a, just a classic example of fraud is if you were to go to a shopping mall and lose your wall and someone were to grab your wall and go on a spending spree, those are transactions that you didn't authorize. For this particular charge, you agreed to this transaction, and and you agreed to it when you provided your Cash app information and transferred the funds.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, we did not agree to give them money. This was our, this was our money. So we didn't agree to pay anyone.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Well then if you didn't agree to it. how did they get your card information? How did how did this transaction happen?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> For the investment, to keep the job.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yeah be yeah. So the expectation is that you were going to receive some type of goods or service for the transaction. This isn't, we're a victim of of a scan. This is a transaction that you, that your wife participated in. This was, this doesn't meet our definition of fraud. There's a, there's an important distinction there. Okay. I there's nothing more that I would like to add in regards to this process. I I do. I do need to go. okay?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I, I will need to call back because this will be, um, this will be filed again, until we get this result, because this is, is there any way, before I bother you more, Is there any way that I can route this, any other ways that I can route this to, to solve this problem?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> You're asking, is there a different way that we can handle this situation?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yes.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I, I, there is not. I'm gonna leave some feedback on the account but this type of transaction is generally not disputable. Thank you very much for your time.</p>

							<div class="transcript-content">
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Hello, my name is Kay. I'm a billing supervisor with Discover. How may I help?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> This is …(my husband's name). You remember me, right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, um-</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I request to talk with the supervisor, Ben? Is he available?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, he is not.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Um, are you a supervisor?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, I am.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I have your supervisor, please?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, you cannot.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Why can't I?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Because I am the supervisor that's here as of now.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Well, I need to speak to your supervisor, please.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> You're not able to. Um, can I have your name?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Do you have a note of our previous conversation?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes I do.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> What does it say?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, um it says customer believe they are victim of a scam. I've asked this was a peer to peer transfer. There's transfer, customer willing participating in this transaction. As of now this case is considered an inconvenience.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yes, we, we don't believe it. We are the victims and this is not a peer to peer transaction. I, I, I, said this many, many times-</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> That's what Cash App is used for sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, we didn't, we didn't send it to anyone. We were sending it to get a product, the investment, that we need to get returned. And also, I asked for the email, and then, we even verify the email to send the, the rule book of the company that specifies that, the Cash app is not able to dispute this type of transaction. We didn't get any emails after 2 hours. Do you have that on note? This is why I wanted to talk to Ben, who was, who were we were talking to. And you cannot-</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Listen, Ben left a note on the account stating that they did speak with the previous um customer basically with you guys stating that this transaction is considered an inconvenience due to it being a peer to peer transaction.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> What? Inconvenience due to what?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> It's being a peer to peer transaction and cash app is used to be for a peer to peer transaction meaning the platform is used to send money for a peer to peer transaction and that's what occurred.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, it, it, it is not a peer to peer transaction. This was a, this was not, this was a purchase for the employer, not necessarily purchase, but this is not just sending money peer to peer. This was electronic, we didn't use cash. Okay, I don't know why you guys keep saying they were using cash. There was no cash involved. This was an electronic transfer. And also, where is the rule book that states? Can you, can you please tell me that it was promised? We even validated our email.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Okay sir, so if the merchant successfully transfers the requested funds that would mean the merchant fulfilled their obligation. So that would mean that the dispute is actually with a 3rd party not with-</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> We did not get any product that we were promised from the merchant.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> The merchant is not cash-so cash app is the merchant in this case and cash app fulfilled their obligation by transferring the requested funds. Your dispute would be with the 3rd party not the merchant.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Dispute to the 3rd party and who's the 3rd party in this case?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> To whom you feel as if they not provide you with services for sending these funds-</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, so you're talking about the scammer, right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> via cash app.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So you're pointing finger at some other people, you're too busy pointing finger at other platforms and the scammer, and you're telling us that, the good people with good intentions have to just lose. I need to talk to your supervisor, please. And, are you sending me the email?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> So as of now I'm showing a letter was sent out on December 4th, 2025.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, no, no. What?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I can I can resend out as of now I'm showing that there was a letter sent out for this dispute stating-</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, I need- Send it to the email, please.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> How this transaction is valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> We verified the email, it was promised by Ben that we will get an email. I've been waiting for that. The call was recorded, you can revisit it.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I can send it to the mail address we have on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, send it to the email. How many times do I have to tell you? Can you not tell the difference between mail and email?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> That's fine sir, but I have to go by policy and procedure. I have to go by-</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Ben told me specifically that he will send me an email, go back to the call recording and re-listen to it. Now you guys are sending us an email that's going to take 2 weeks to arrive.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I understand your frustration. As of now, we have to go by policy and procedure, which would be to send the letter to the mail address we have on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> When did this policy develop? Five minutes ago? Why was the policy different when we were talking earlier with different supervisor? Are you even a supervisor?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, I actually am, sir, and I'm showing that the previous supervisor. I have an employee number. My name is Kay and I'm a billing supervisor with Discover and as of now this transaction is valid,</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can you spell that out? Your 1st and last name, please?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> K A Y.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And your last name? You don't have a last name?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No last name, sir, no last name.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> What policy, you, the policy that you just made up, because Ben told me his last name. Oh, so it's different policy per person?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Okay that's fine sir. I do not have to release my last name, sir, to you um, as far as speaking to another supervisor. You're not able to. I am the supervisor that's here as of now, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, I need to talk to your supervisor. This needs to be escalated.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, I do not have to release my last name, sir, to you um, as far as speaking to another supervisor. You're not able to. I am the supervisor that's here as of now, sir. In regards of speaking with my supervisor in regards of a resolution for this case you're not able to, sir. If you would like guidance somehow to get a further resolution, I'd be more than happy to do so, but as of now this transaction is a valid transaction.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, what's the further resolution that you're talking about? Besides blaming other platforms.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, you were able to go through outside resources from Discover which would be the Better Business Bureau or your local attorney general.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Wait, what, what, can you say again?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes sir, you're able to go to your local attorney general, you're also able to go to the Better Business Bureau.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And how long that's gonna take? Well, that amount that we lost is sitting there accumulating interest?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> You would have to reach out to those companies to see how long it would take that would be up, it would depend on you reaching out to them to see um and how long that would take in the process you go through with them so that just depends on your interaction with those companies.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So until we go through the process, can we have that lost money back and make decision later?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now the transaction is valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Is that the resolution that you're giving me? Talk to other people?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, this this is the resolution that was given on December 4th 2025 yes sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, I'm calling you as Discover to find the resolution, and you're telling me that to go to someone else to find the resolution where the card was from Discover. I'm calling Discover.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, and Discover opening evaluation and when Discover opened this investigation, the merchant sent this documentation on how this transaction was authorized and stating that this transaction was a peer-to-peer payment using Cash App. And the sender authorized payment at the point of transfer where they entered in their debit card information and sent funds to the recipient's email. Response was successful and it was confirmed recipient successfully redeemed payment by inputting their debit card information. As of now, I'm reading the documentation that was sent to Discover from the merchant on November 21, 2025.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can you send that? Can you send that to our email?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Um so no it will be sent to the mail address we have on file it was sent on December 4, 2025. I can resend it to that mail address we have on file if you would like on today.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, why not on email? Why are you telling me a completely different story than the previous person?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I'm sorry what the previous person may have told you, sir, but I am the supervisor that's here as of now and I'm giving you a resolution as of now. I do understand that someone may have told you something differently but this is my way of assisting.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I can't have different answers between 2 people. I need to talk to someone who can actually give me a right answer.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Well I did give the right answer and and this is the further steps for resolution as of now, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Do you have a recording of the previous call? Do you have that?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Discover has the recording of the previous call, yes, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Are you able to access the previous recording?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> While we're on the phone? No, sir. I am not able to access that phone call record. No, I am not able to do so either so, but I am able to put in a a call recording review or something as such if that's what you would like, but as of now for this transaction, it's a valid transaction from what was decided from the merchant documents.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Valid because of what? Why are you saying this is a valid transaction?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Did you receive the documents on this from December 4th 2025 that was sent to the mail address that we have on file?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, I'm saying, I'm saying we don't have it. So can you send it through email, which you're saying that it's gonna be on mail? Right? What's the point of your asking me that?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> So I'm I'm only allowed to send it the the where the, um, on, the point of me asking that is to see if you have the documents that decided the case as of now and if you don't have them I'd be more than happy to send it to the mail address we have on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yes, if you're gonna send it to mail. Why are you asking me that? Because I don't, that's why I'm telling you to send it through email? Right? Does that does that click to you?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Well, I'm asking you because it was already sent through mail and you may have you may have it as of now if it was sent to the mail address on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> If I have it, then why would I? Why would I keep asking you to send an email?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> It was sent to the mail address we have on file with the card member, sir, so she may have it.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And this, we talk about the same thing, right? So this will indicate the statement that the discover, uh, officially does not, uh, dispute any transaction with Cash App. Is that correct?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Can you clarify?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Clarify what? You're saying that Discover cannot dispute any transaction between Cash App, is that correct? That was your statement?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No that's not what I've stated. I'm stating for this transaction, the merchant successfully transferred the requested funds, and the merchant fulfilled their obligation, for this transaction with cash app. Yes.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> We did not pay the cash app. We paid, uh- the cash app was the intermediator. It was a middleman.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No Cash App is a merchant, sir. Cash App is the merchant, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Look, can I talk to your supervisor, please?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, you cannot as of now.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can you tell me what our situation is here, then?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> But I can get further guidance on how to get a further resolution if you would like.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no. Can you tell me what you understand about our situation?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I understand that as of now, that you feel as if you used Cash App as a platform to send money to a merchant and you feel as if Cash App is not the merchant you're sending funds to or and using Cash App as a middleman to send funds to this merchant and you feel as if this merchant did not fulfill or give you services for what you've paid for. Trust me I understand exactly what you're stating. I understand the frustrations and basically spending money for something and not receiving an item. However, this transaction is through cash app and cash app is a platform  to send funds. So if cash app didn't send the funds then yes that would be a totally understanding but cash app actually fulfilled their obligation which was to send the funds. Your dispute would be with the 3rd party who authorized this transaction to go through perhaps cash app and you would pursue this 3rd party further outside of discover which would be the Better Business bureau or the-the, your attorney general.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Look, do you honestly think that this makes sense to you? The Cash app is a, is a middleman. You said that yourself, right? The money is from Discover. Right? So you're saying that we bought stuff from Cash App?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now the transaction was decided as a valid transaction.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So, I need to speak to your supervisor, then, because this...</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Oh, as of now the transaction is valid and you would have to go through outside resources from Discover to get a further resolution.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, the the thing is, the card, the money, that money is being charged from you. So I don't know why you keep on blaming the 3rd party. Right? We have an account with you, discover, which guarantees the protection of the innocent people, with the credit card. That's the whole point of having credit card. And now you're, you're too busy blaming on some 3rd party, middle, middlemen, saying that, oh, transactions, value some script reading, sentences, same thing over and over, and the, the, cannot even send the rule book, through email, you guys don't have email as company, or what? Now we have to wait for 2 weeks. And now this is a different story from the previous supervisor. So, so I need to talk to somebody who's higher than you who can actually solve this. Okay?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, as of now, the transaction is a valid transaction. I can resend the merchant documents to the mail address we have on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can you reopen the case and then, uh, do, do more the research? We, we will send you more documents. Can you even do that?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Um so, in regards of the the dispute letter, so the dispute letter was mailed to, the email address we have on file, yes? So this is this is what I'm gonna do for you. I'm I'm going to send the dispute, but I'm not so as far as appealing, the transaction would remain valid as of now, I sent the dispute letter to the email we have on file as far as the merchant documents that will go to the mail address we have on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, I don't need a dispute letter. Okay? I'm asking for the appeal.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> So as far as an appeal, that's something that we cannot do as of now, the transaction will remain as valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So, so you guys saying there's nothing can be done. Is that what you're saying?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now no, no.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And you cannot even send me the, the rule, the official statement from the company saying that Cash App cannot be disputed. Cash App transaction cannot be disputed. Is that correct?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> So uh the it wouldn't say that specifically what it will say is this was a peer to peer transaction.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Look, look. Okay. If, if you have time, please go over the previous call that we had with Ben, I forgot his last name, but do you know him personally? Do you guys work together?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Um so, me and Ben does not work, specifically work together but, we do follow each other notations so in regards of knowing who Ben is. I do see his notations on the account.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And then another thing, tell him to notate the right thing. We did not authorize this. Okay? We did not authorize this. We did not receive the goods that we were promised to receive. Okay. I I don't know why that was saying that, okay, you need to modify that the first thing. Okay? You understand that?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So here's the thing. You know, we're the customers of discovery, right? And we have nothing but good intentions. Do you know?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And we're not trying to fraud in one, we're literally, we have a good intention. And we're literally victim of this fraud. Do you understand that?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Discover appreciate your business. In regards of the dispute, not going in your, yes, in in regards of the dispute going in your favor, doesn't mean discovery does not appreciate your business, it's just a dispute, um, in your favor, and we have to go by policy and procedure.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, the policy you're saying is that to protect the fraud, to protect the scammers, not your own customers, with good intentions only. Right? Is that correct? It looks like that's how it's gonna be. No matter what I do, no matter what we do, we're just gonna be the victim because you guys want to side with the fraud and scammers. Right? That's how it's sounds right now. No matter how many times, different stories, different excuses. By the way, this call is being recorded for quality purposes and our own protection. Okay?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So, sounds about right, correct? Kay? What do you think?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now the transaction is valid um due to-</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, no. Can you answer my question? If you don't, then I'll.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> What is your question?</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So we have nothing but good attention, right? Is that right? So you do understand that.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I don't personally know your intentions so I I'm not able to answer yes to that. I would think that you have good attention so yes, but as far as you have good intentions, I, I don't know your intentions, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> You guys are siding with the scammers? Is it right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> This isn't your your specific account. This is someone else's account that and I'm talking to you on behalf of them so as far as your intentions are, I'm gonna speak to your intentions, sir.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Someone else's account. Yeah, this is our account that you're talking about. Yes, this is our account that we're talking about. Our money that we're talking about, our money that you guys promised to take care of.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now the transaction is valid. I resent out the letter to the email and also to the mail address that we have on file. Yes I sent the letter to the email address we have on file.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> And this is the rule book, the specific rule statement, official statement saying that the cash app is not support. I mean, it cannot be disputed, right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Um one moment I can read you the the letter on what it says one moment. Um so because I said that I it would specifically say that statement. But I can't read you what the letter states um because this letter was sent out states: "we received your request to dispute the transaction for $618 on your Discover card account. And are sorry to hear you had a bad experience with Cash App. We cannot, however, continue further with an investigation on your behalf. With a merchant based on the reason you have provided for the requesting to dispute this transaction. As a result, the transaction remains a part of your account balance unless already paid and it's is subject to interest calculations if applicable and calculation of your minimum payment due. If a temporary credit was applied to your account, it has been reversed".</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> No, no, hold on, hold on. This is the result of the dispute. You're reading the result of the dispute. I need a official rule, a pre-stated rule before we got involved into Discover at all, saying that Cash App is not supported. This way, we know that you guys are not making decisions. Uh, Based on situation, it was already, uh, created, that rule was rule existed before we got into situation. That's why you guys cannot do it. Not because you guys don't want to, you guys don't want to help us. Right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, no one? No, that's not true um.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yes, that's why, that's what I'm asking. And, and look, Ben told me that there, he's gonna send me an email, so I've been waiting for that. So I need, I need the rule book, official, rule, saying that policy.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yeah, I I do see it being sent out the same the same letter I sent Ben sent out the same letter I sent out as well.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Wait, no, what you just read is it's just the result of the dispute.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Yes, and that is the result of the dispute as of now and this transaction is valid as of now. You would have to go through outside resources from Discover, if you would like a different resolution.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can talk to your supervisor, please, I don't have time.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> No, you cannot, sir. As of now this transaction is valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I'm requesting this to be escalated.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now this transaction is valid, you would have to go through outside resources from Discover.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> I need to further escalate this.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> You have already been escalated to a supervisor. I'm the supervisor of now, if you would like a different resolution, you would have to go through outside resources from Discover, which, as of now this transaction is valid. It's uh it, Discover has exhausted, its avenues in regards of this dispute as of now, you are, you would have to go through outside resources, which would be-. Discover and the letter that was sent out as of now this transaction is valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Who made the decision? Which team made that decision?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> The dispute department. As of now the transaction is valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Can you escalate it to the dispute department, then?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> The dispute department did decide this as of now, the transaction remain valid um due to there being no, no information wi- without no information to further investigate no.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> We have all the documents that you haven't received. And the story is completely different from what-</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> You're you're more than welcome to you're more than welcome to send in documents but as of now the transaction would remain valid as of now.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> The reasons that you guys are giving me, and the notes that I heard, in the beginning of this call is not correct.</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> I totally understand what you are stating. um the merchant has also sent um notations as such to discover in regards of the dispute. If you would like to further dispute, you are able to send in documents, but as of now the transaction will remain valid.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> What do you mean, further dispute?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> So you're able to send in documents to further investigate um that doesn't necessarily mean the dispute would be going in your favor anything as such. I'm just giving you a way to get this a dispute further investigating. Um as far as reopening the case uh it would not just reopen the dispute the the documents would have to be reviewed 1st.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So can we escalate that then? How do we do that?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> You're able to send in documents. To support your claim. But Cash App has already sent in documents to show how the transaction is valid and those documents were already sent in to you. I don't know what if you have received them yet, but I did resend them out as well. So you are able to send in documents as well just like Cash App was.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> What? Cash app sent? What, so you're saying the cash app have sent the transaction history? Is that right?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> Um no Cash App sent uh document to validate the transaction on November 21, 2025.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Just the money movement history. Not the actual case that you guys really need to hear, to protect that you guys promised as a credit card company. What are you guys are protecting if this is not the case?</p>
								
								<p class="agent-message"><strong>Agent:</strong> As of now we've opened the investigation.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> What investigation did you guys do? Yeah, the merchant, the Cash App, and then you just got the history of the money movement. Huh? No, no, no. That's not the investigation that you guys do. You guys need to do further investigation that we actually got into this game. Look, look, why, I don't know why you keep saying outside resources. This is your card. Uh, Discover also promise to protect these kind of cases. Protect us from these kind of cases. And you guys are the ones who's charging us. Charging interest. So this needs to be done through you guys eventually, even the money comes back to us, it's gonna be you guys. Do you get that? I need to talk to your supervisor. I need to speak to someone who can solve this. We can actually do the investigation. I need to reappeal it. I need to find a way to appeal it. I want you to find a way to appeal it.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, how do we send the documents? With what context? I need more detailed descriptions and that. But with what content, you guys don't need any previous dispute number, nothing. Were you just saying that? Can you send the official instruction of the sending additional documents to appeal a rejected dispute? Can you send me the email? Email? Why is that? So there is no generated email for that? There is no official. So what are you sending me through mail? Your own statement? No, I just said that I need a instructions to appeal the rejected dispute. No, no, I need an instruction. Okay, because you told me we can send in documents to to appeal this, right? So I need that instruction. Yeah, exactly, get a review or make it look over again. So I need an instruction. Official instruction. So, are you saying we have to wait 10 days? Where does it say that? To through a mailing address? We did not receive it. We did not receive it. Okay. No, no, no. We, we did not receive that information. You guys have failed to deliver, that we can reopen the case within 10 days. Okay? Well, so this needs to be revisited. No, no, no, we, we did not receive the information telling us that we could revisit the, the claim or dispute case by submitting more documents. This is why we're going through all this calls.</p>
								
								<p class="me-message"><strong>Me:</strong> So, so do you have the receipt saying that it's been delivered? No, no, no. Do you have, Do you have a state? Do you have a record saying that the letter was delivered to our address? So how long does it take? Didn't you say 10 days? Okay, 1st of all, send me the 10 day statement saying letter to my email, please. And secondly, if it takes 5 to 7 business days, that means that's 2 weeks, that's over 10 days. So, yeah, email on file is fine. Okay, email on file is fine. But we, we need the official statement, instead of y'all just telling us different story every time. Okay? We need an official rule book and policy from Discover, saying that what's what? Yeah, yeah, but can you can you send those official statement that I've been asking throughout this call? For 40 minutes. So, you guys don't even have official statement of what you guys saying. No official statement. Are you a supervisor? Do you have power as a supervisor? Are you? Did you just start working or something? How are you not able to send me anything? You guys don't have a rule book of the policy book? or whatever? No, I need, I need to receive information about the company policy, and this is very important. I need a clarification. No, no, that's not what I'm asking. You're not answering my question. Okay? If you're a supervisor, you need to answer my question, if you're the person that we need to talk to, if you're the person that we need to talk to, you need to answer my question instead of just saying, same scriptline every time. Okay? Send me the official rule books that back, everything that you're saying and everything that I've been asking for throughout this call. Send me a you can you can get a statement from the company itself, okay? Because you know why? Because I'm the, you're the only person I can talk to. So you need to, you need to grab this.</p>

								<p><em><strong>Update (December 22, 2025):</strong> As of today, I still haven't received any message on the Discover app or my email with instructions on how to send additional documents or proofs. Two days after this call, I received the same denial message I had received before, stating that the dispute was denied. No follow-up, no opportunity to provide additional evidence, just the same automated rejection.</em></p>
